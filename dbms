Checking Out a Book:

When a member checks out a book, you need to insert a record into the Loans table and decrement the CopiesAvailable in the Books table.


BEGIN;

INSERT INTO Loans (BookID, MemberID, IssueDate, DueDate)
VALUES (1, 1, CURDATE(), DATE_ADD(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 14 DAY));

UPDATE Books
SET CopiesAvailable = CopiesAvailable - 1
WHERE BookID = 1;

COMMIT;

Returning a Book:

When a member returns a book, update the Loans table to set the ReturnDate and increment the CopiesAvailable in the Books table.


BEGIN;

UPDATE Loans
SET ReturnDate = CURDATE()
WHERE LoanID = 1;

UPDATE Books
SET CopiesAvailable = CopiesAvailable + 1
WHERE BookID = (SELECT BookID FROM Loans WHERE LoanID = 1);

COMMIT;
